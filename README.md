## Secured Password Generator 
This highly flexible password generator can easily create passwords with just the press of a button. The user has full control on how long they would like their password to be as well as which characters they want to include in the given length. 

## How to operate
When clicking on "Generate Password", the user will be prompted with a series of questions asking them how long should the password be, if they would like to use lowercase/upper case characters, numbers and or symbols. Once all the questions have been answer, the program will collect the inputs and provide an unique password back inside the white box in the middle of the screen.
